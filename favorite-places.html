    <h2>Kangaroo Island</h2>

    <p>Yes, I know what you're thinking, "an island full of
    kangaroos?" Kind of, but not really. Kangaroo island
    lies just Southwest from the tip of Adelaide Australia.
    What makes this island so fasinating is it's diversity in
    regards to terrian and animal life. To give you a quick
    idea of what I'm talking about, if you only had a short
    period of time to travel, but you wanted to get a great
    idea of the terrian, animals and feel of most of Australia,
    you can experience that on Kangaroo Island. Yes the island
    does have a lot of whild kangaroo, but you'll see wild
    wallabies, qualabears, sea lions, all kinds  mammals, birds,
    reptiles/aphebians and insects. I is truley an adventure.
    Did I mentioned terrian?! From sand dunes, to thick brush,
    on to gorgious beach and more. This place has room for a kinds
    of active activities which include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <li>Sand Boarding</li>
      <li>Surfing</li>
      <li>Animal Watching</li>
      <li>Off Roading</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are just to name a few. The island also has all kinds
    of unique places to eat and enjoy the local wines and beers. If
    you have a little extra cash to spare, I'd suggest you pay for a
    tour package, where a local will pick you up in Adelaide and take
    you all around the island explaing all the history and animal life.
    You will get a chance to spend the night under the stars as you
    share campfire stories and cook <em>shrimp on the barbie</em>.
    I can sit here all day explaing the details of this little oasis,
    but if you want more information, view more on it on one of my
    favorite websites, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/south-australia/kangaroo-island">
    <em>Loney Planet</em></a>.</p>

    <p>I hope you enjoyed my brief breakdown of Kangaroo Island. Happy
    travels, and as the locals say, "Gu day mate."</p>
